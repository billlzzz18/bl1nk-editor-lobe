# Bl1nkOS Editor Privacy Policy (Mock)

**Effective Date: November 10, 2025**

This is a mock Privacy Policy to demonstrate the required documentation structure.

## 1. Data Collection and Use

**Local-First Principle:** The Bl1nkOS Editor is designed on a **Local-First** principle. Your documents and creative content are stored primarily on your device (using the Isar database) and are not automatically uploaded to any central cloud server.

**Data Collected by the App (Local):**
*   **User Content:** Your Markdown documents, notes, and projects.
*   **Local Metadata:** Document creation/modification dates, local file paths, and application settings.

**Data Collected by the bl1nk-core Server (Minimal):**
*   **Pipe Sync Metadata:** The server logs the initiation and connection of the 6-digit pipe code, including the device IDs and timestamps. **The server does NOT store the content of the files transferred.**
*   **Memory/Indexing Logs:** The server logs metadata about indexing and search operations (e.g., query, document ID, duration) for performance and auditing purposes. **The server does NOT store the full content of the documents being indexed.**

## 2. Third-Party Services (Bring Your Own Key)

The application allows you to use your own API keys for third-party AI services (e.g., Voyage.ai, Mistral).

*   **Your Responsibility:** You are responsible for the data you send to these third-party services and must adhere to their respective privacy policies.
*   **Key Storage:** Your API keys are stored locally on your device and are **NOT** transmitted to the `bl1nk-core` server.

## 3. Data Security

We implement industry-standard security measures to protect the minimal data collected by the `bl1nk-core` server. All communication between the app and the server is encrypted via HTTPS.

## 4. Changes to This Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
